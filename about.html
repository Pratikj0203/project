    <p>The powers of the legislature in India are exercised by the Parliament, a bicameral legislature consisting of the
      Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha. Of the two houses of parliament, the Rajya Sabha (or the 'Council of States') is
      considered to be the upper house and consists of members appointed by the president and elected by the state and
      territorial legislatures. The Lok Sabha (or the 'House of the People') is considered the lower house.[7]

      The parliament does not have complete control and sovereignty, as its laws are subject to judicial review by the
      Supreme Court.[8] However, it does exercise some control over the executive. The members of the Council of
      Ministers, including the prime minister, are either chosen from parliament or elected thereto within six months of
      assuming office.[9] The council as a whole is responsible to the Lok Sabha.[10] The Lok Sabha is a temporary house
      and can be dissolved only when the party in power loses the support of the majority of the house. The Rajya Sabha
      is a permanent house and can never be dissolved. The members of the Rajya Sabha are elected for a six-year
      term.[11]
